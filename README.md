# Match_Mind


Project Summary
Developed a Flask-based web application for managing, displaying, and analyzing football player statistics by match round. The system supports real-time data entry via an admin panel without permanent storage, player searching and filtering, round-based data browsing, player comparison with visual highlighting for best/worst values, and individual player performance analysis across rounds.

Key Features

Admin Panel – Add, edit, and delete player stats in memory.

Data Page – Search and filter players by round, name, and team.

Top Players Display – Automatically calculates and shows top 3 scorers per round.

Player Comparison – Compare multiple players with colored highlights for highest/lowest values.

Player Analysis – Shows cumulative and average stats, plus peak performance per category.

Tech Stack & Tools
